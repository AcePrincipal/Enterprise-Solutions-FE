Welcome to Enterprise Solutions!

This is a single-page web application utilizing components, routes, axios, redux, and thunk! It is programmed with Javascript, with some HTML and CSS, as well as some bootstrap. There is a second part of this application that is a Ruby on Rails backend that can be found here: `https://github.com/AcePrincipal/ESBackEnd`

Strating the app with `PORT=3001 npm start` and `rails s` with the back-end part of the app, the page will open functionally on your browser of choice, which I suggest to be `Google Chrome`. 

The first thing noticed will be a `welcome page` that welcomes users, and gives them some insight on the application. At the top of the website, there is a navigation bar with links to specific parts of the application. Going from left-to-right, the second link brings a user to the products page, which hosts 3 products, with prices, and buttons available to click to `Add to cart`. Clicking on a button will create an estamated total on the bottom of the page with an asterisk next to it, and an explination saying that contacting us will produce a more accurate financial quote, and finalize a deal. The next link brings the user to a reviews page, where annonymous reviews are hosted and can be posted, with a title and a review. Next is the `about us` page, that gives more information about ES. Finally, the last link on the navigation bar is `contact us`, wich has the company's information, and how to contact them.

Thank you!


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
